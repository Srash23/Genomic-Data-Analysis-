This project focuses on the computational translation of DNA sequences into proteins, elucidating the process by which genetic information (genotype) manifests as physical and biochemical traits (phenotype). Employing a two-step bioinformatics approach, the project transcribes DNA into RNA and then translates RNA into proteins. Key features include identifying differences in amino acid frequencies between gene sequences and generating visual and textual reports on these differences. This tool enhances our understanding of genetic mechanisms, supporting disease research, evolutionary studies, and biotechnological applications by bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype.This project focuses on the computational translation of DNA sequences into proteins, elucidating the process by which genetic information (genotype) manifests as physical and biochemical traits (phenotype).
